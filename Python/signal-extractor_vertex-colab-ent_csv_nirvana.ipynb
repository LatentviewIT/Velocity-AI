        "\n",
        "You have three primary objectives:\n",
        "\n",

        "   {json.dumps(SIGNAL_TAXONOMY_LIST, indent=2)}\n",

        "   - Rate the SPM's effectiveness (1-100) based on Empathy, Clarity, and Resolution.\n",
        "   - **Agenda Adherence Penalty:** Compare the topics the SPM stated they would discuss against what was ACTUALLY covered. Heavily penalize the score if the SPM claims to have discussed topics that were not covered (e.g., stated 5 topics but only covered 2).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING RULES:\n",
        "   - NEVER use double quotes (\"\") inside any of your text values.\n",
        "   - If you need to quote the creator or emphasize a word, you MUST use single quotes ('') instead to avoid breaking the JSON structure.\n",
